VIPER Configuration
=========================================

VIPER can be configured in two ways:

- ROS dynamic reconfigure;
- VIPER Web panel.

ROS dynamic reconfigure
=========================================

Since VIPER is based on ROS, all the nodes are configurable via `dynamic_reconfigure`_.
All parameters can be accessed via `rqt`_ dynamic reconfigure plugin.

----------------------------------------
VIPER Core Configuration
----------------------------------------

VIPER Core has the following nodes and parameters.

cvm_description
----------------------------------------
When the camera is attached to a robot it might be necessary to take it into account by describing the setup.

parent_link
  Robot link to which camera is attached. If empty, transform is not published. Empty is default.

rotation_r
  Roll relative to the parent link's reference frame in radians. Default: 0.0. Range: [-3.14; 3.14].

rotation_p
  Pitch relative to the parent link's reference frame in radians. Default: 0.0. Range: [-3.14; 3.14].

rotation_y
  Yaw relative to the parent link's reference frame in radians. Default: 0.0. Range: [-3.14; 3.14].

position_x
  X translation relative to the parent link's reference frame in meters. Default: 0.0. Range: [-10.0; 10.0].

position_y
  Y translation relative to the parent link's reference frame in meters. Default: 0.0. Range: [-10.0; 10.0].

position_z
  Z translation relative to the parent link's reference frame in meters. Default: 0.0. Range: [-10.0; 10.0].

cvm_v4l2_camera
----------------------------------------

resolution
  Camera resolution can be changed to the following values:

  **1280x360** Original nHD from camera driver. Default.

  **2560x720** Original HD from camera driver.

cvm_stereo/disparity_nodelet
----------------------------------------

stereo_algorithm
  Stereo matching algorithm. It affects accuracy of point clouds.

  **StereoSGBM_VW** SGBM that comes from VisionWorks library. Slower and more robust than the other. Default.

  **StereoSGM_HZ** Hernandez's implementation of SGM. Faster, but it produces more noise.


----------------------------------------
FollowMe App Configuration
----------------------------------------

cvm_follow_me
----------------------------------------

drop_time
  Time after which the target should be dropped if not seen, in seconds. Default: 5. Range: [0.2; 30].

detection_prob
  Probability threshold to assume that the correct object class has been detected. Default: 0.25. Range: [0.0; 1.0].

similarity_threshold
  Visual similarity of the object in the subsequent frame. Default: 0.6. Range: [0.0; 1.0].

history_queue
  Queue size for storing visual data. If 0 then visual data is not compared. Default: 15. Range: [0; 100].

cvm_follow_me/cvm_object_detector
----------------------------------------

camera_rotation
  If camera has been rotated, correct parameter has to be set for human recognition to work.
  Camera rotation types:

  **0** default. Camera is in its regular position.

  **1** CW_90. Camera is rotated 90 degrees clock wise.

  **2** CCW_90. Camera is rotated 90 degrees counter clock wise.


----------------------------------------
Obstacle Detector App Configuration
----------------------------------------

cvm_laserscan
----------------------------------------

target_frame
  If provided, transforms the pointcloud into this frame before converting to a laser scan. If the target frame is set to the robot base link or another part that is parallel to the ground, laser scan will also be parallel to the ground.
  Empty is default.

min_height
  The minimum height to sample in the point cloud in meters. Default: -1.0. Range: [-10.0; 10.0].

max_height
  The maximum height to sample in the point cloud in meters. Default: 1.0. Range: [-10.0; 10.0].

min_angle
  The minimum scan angle in radians. Default: -0.77. Range: [-3.14; 3.14].

max_angle
  The maximum scan angle in radians. Default: 0.77. Range: [-3.14; 3.14].

angle_increment
  Resolution of laser scan in radians per ray. Default: 0.01. Range: [-3.14; 3.14].

scan_time
  The scan rate in seconds. Default: 0.33. Range: [0.0; 1.0].

min_range
  The minimum ranges to return in meters. Default: 1.0. Range: [0.0; 50.0].

max_range
  The maximum ranges to return in meters. Default: 25.0. Range: [0.0; 50.0].

use_inf
  If disabled, report infinite range (no obstacle) as ``range_max`` + 1. Otherwise report infinite range as ``+inf``. ``False`` is default.

VIPER Web panel
=========================================

When you are connected to the same network as VIPER, you should be able to access
VIPER Web panel by opening a browser and entering IP address of your VIPER.

----------------------------------------
Overview
----------------------------------------

In the picture below you can see what sections are available in VIPER web panel.

The following sections are available:

- CVM Versions
- Robot config
- Applications
- System actions
- Network config
- System time
- System info


.. image:: web_panel_img/web_panel_0-start-800.png

.. note:: Initially some sections are collapsed, and some are expanded - you can mouse click on heading and section will change between collapsed and expanded state.


----------------------------------------
CVM Version
----------------------------------------

In this section current CVM version is shown.

If VIPER is connected to the internet, it verifies if there is any newer version of CVM software.
If newer CVM version is available - update action will be presented to the user.


.. image:: web_panel_img/web_panel_1-versions-800.png

Version update, depending on internet connection speed, can take up to 30 minutes. Reload page after some time to verify if update has completed.


----------------------------------------
Robot config
----------------------------------------

In this section Robot configuration parameters can be adjusted.
This section is collapsed by default - mouse click on the heading and section will expand.

.. image:: web_panel_img/web_panel_2-robot_config-800.png

If VIPER is being used on the robot, these parameters should be adjusted acordingly.

.. note:: If any value changes in this section - applications should be restarted i.e. deactivate and activate every application that you use.


----------------------------------------
Applications
----------------------------------------

The list of applications is shown here.

For every application additional information is shown:

- application or package title e.g. Follow Me Package
- list of modules e.g. cvm-object-tracker, cvm-position-estimator etc.
- license status of each module e.g. License is valid
- license actions: **request license** and **install license** - click on these titles for more information to be shown
- application status: *Active*, *Inactive*, *Active (on external ROS)*
- actions: **Activate**, **Activate with External ROS**

.. note:: You will be asked to confirm your action before VIPER executes it.

.. image:: web_panel_img/web_panel_3-apps-800.png

In the picture below you can see what information and actions are available for license handling.

When you have new VIPER then most likely applications (some or all) will have no license installed. In this case, you have to send license request to the email address 'licensing@rubedos.com'. In the body of license request email you have to include VIPER information (as shown in the picture - copy and paste from the web panel). Also, in the license request you have to include information about yourself and your organization.

.. image:: web_panel_img/web_panel_3-apps-1-licenses-800.png

After your license request is fulfilled, you should receive license files (one file or multiple files). Then you should upload these files into VIPER web panel by pressing **install license** then **Choose file**. After you execute this action, page will reload and application module license status will be updated.

.. note:: At any time do not forget to reload page to get the most current information about application status!

.. note:: If you are using robot setup i.e. camera is mounted on some kind of robot with its own computer running with ROS, and you activate application with external ROS, VIPER periodically (every 2 minutes) will check if external ROS is *alive*, and, if it is alive i.e. responding, then VIPER activates application (which previously was activated with external ROS). If VIPER detects that external ROS is not responding, then it deactivates application until next check is performed. Also, you can deactivate or activate application at any time by yourself.


----------------------------------------
System actions
----------------------------------------

Available system actions:

- Shutdown
- Reboot

.. note:: You will be asked to confirm your action before VIPER executes it.

.. image:: web_panel_img/web_panel_4-system-actions-800.png


----------------------------------------
Network config
----------------------------------------

In network configuration section you can adjust network parameters to match your network setup.

.. warning:: Be very careful when changing network configuration - in case of mistake you can loose access to your VIPER device!

.. note:: Changes take effect only after VIPER reboot.

.. image:: web_panel_img/web_panel_5-network-config-800.png

Initially network configuration info section is collapsed - click section heading to expand it.

If you want to edit network configuration - click on the **(edit)** text on the right hand side.

.. image:: web_panel_img/web_panel_5-network-config-1-edit-800.png

After you enter values, click **Submit**, then you will see extra confirmation screen for final review and confirmation.

.. note:: Your changes will take effect only after you do VIPER reboot. Until that, you can make changes if you notice any mistakes.
